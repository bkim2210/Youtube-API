Command-line Arguments:

The script begins by parsing command-line arguments to extract parameters such as the database name, server, audit key, username, password, load type, and table name.
Database Connection:

It uses pyodbc to find the best available driver for SQL Server and establishes a connection to the database using SQLAlchemy.
Error Logging Function:

There's a function named errorLog that logs errors to a specified SQL Server table (log.Error). It includes details like the audit key, error code, error description, date, and source information.
Importing Required Libraries:

The script imports various libraries, including Google API-related libraries (for YouTube data), Azure Identity for authentication, SQLAlchemy for database interaction, and other utilities.
YouTube Data Extraction:

The script then uses the YouTube API to extract details about videos from a specified channel. It retrieves information such as video ID, title, link, publish date, duration, view count, like count, dislike count, and comment count.
Multiple YouTube Channels:

The script supports multiple YouTube channels. It fetches video information for each channel and stores it in a DataFrame.
Merging DataFrames:

It merges the obtained YouTube video information with an existing DataFrame (Comp) that contains video IDs, channel IDs, and channel names.
Data Transformation:

The script rearranges the columns in the DataFrame to a desired order and adds a timestamp for the pull date.
Storing Data in SQL Server:

Finally, the combined and transformed DataFrame is stored in a SQL Server table named Youtube_Channels_Metrics in the schema changeLog.
Note:

It's important to replace placeholder values such as "Enter..." with actual values, especially sensitive information like API keys and database credentials.
